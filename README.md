# Bookshop System - Java Coursework Project

## Project Overview
This project is a Java-based system designed for a bookshop, aimed at streamlining the shop's operations. It caters to two types of users: admins and customers, each with distinct functionalities. The system manages a range of books including paperbacks, ebooks, and audiobooks, each with specific attributes.

## Features
- **Book Management**: Handles books with details like barcode, title, language, genre, release date, stock quantity, and retail price. 
  - Paperbacks include page numbers and condition.
  - Ebooks include page numbers and format (EPUB, MOBI, PDF).
  - Audiobooks include listening length and format (MP3, WMA, AAC).
- **User Roles**: Admin and Customer.
  - **Admins** can view and add new books to the stock.
  - **Customers** can view books, add to shopping basket, make payments, cancel orders, and perform specific searches.
- **Shopping Basket**: Customers can manage their purchases and payments through a shopping basket system.
- **Error Handling**: The system has robust error handling to notify users of issues like out-of-stock items or insufficient credits.
- **User Interface**: Option for both Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command-Line Interface (CLI), with GUI being the more favored option.

## Technical Specifications
- **Language**: Java.
- **Development Environment**: Eclipse.
- **Operating System**: Windows.
- **Data Management**: User details and stock data are managed through `.txt` files (UserAccounts.txt and Stock.txt).

## Requirements
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run the `.jar` file.
- Eclipse IDE for development and modifications.

## Installation and Running
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Eclipse.
3. Run the `bookshop.jar` file directly or through the command line with `java -jar bookshop.jar`.
